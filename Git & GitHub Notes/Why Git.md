# Git & GitHub Course Summary

## 📌 Introduction
This document serves as a high-level summary of our Git & GitHub course. It covers the core mental models required before we start using commands.

### Why learn this?
* **Industry Standard:** Proficiency in Git is expected by almost every engineering employer.
* **Workflow Hygiene:** It prevents the chaos of managing multiple file versions manually.

---

## 1. The Problem: "The Save-As Loop"
Without Version Control, managing a project usually looks like this:
> `Design_Final_v1.doc`
> `Design_Final_v2.doc`
> `Design_Final_REAL_v3.doc`

**The Issue:** This creates file clutter and makes it impossible to know *what* specifically changed between versions.

## 2. The Solution: Snapshots
Git solves this by taking **Snapshots**.
* Instead of saving multiple copies of a file, Git records the changes made to a single file over time.
* **The Lab Notebook:** Every snapshot includes a "Commit Message" explaining *what* changed and *why*, creating a clear history log of the project.

## 3. Key Concepts for the Team
| Concept | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time Travel** | If we break the code, we can "rewind" the project to a specific snapshot where everything was working. |
| **Collaboration** | Multiple members can work on the same file at the same time without overwriting each other. |
| **Branching** | We can create safe "playgrounds" to test experimental features without breaking the main code. |

### ✅ Next Step
**Git is our safety net.** It allows us to experiment and collaborate without fear of losing work.

## 4. Installation Guide
Before we can code, every team member needs Git installed.

### 📥 Step 1: Download
1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
2. **Mac/Linux:** Download the default version shown.
3. **Windows:** Download **"Git for Windows"**.
   * *Why?* This provides a "UNIX-like" terminal (Git Bash), ensuring all team members use the exact same commands regardless of their OS.

### 🛠 Step 2: Verify Installation
Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and type:
```bash
git --version
````

*If you see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.x.x`), you are ready.*

## 5\. First-Time Configuration (Important\!)

Git needs to know **who** is making changes to the code. You only need to do this once.

### 🆔 Set Your Identity

Run these two commands (replace with your actual info):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** The email address **must** match the email you used to sign up for GitHub. If they don't match, your contributions won't show up on our team repository.

### 📝 Set Your Default Editor

When you need to write a long message, Git will open a text editor. The course suggests Notepad for simplicity, but you can set your preferred one.

```bash
# To set Notepad (Simple, recommended for beginners)
git config --global core.editor "notepad"

# OR use Atom/VS Code if you have them installed
git config --global core.editor "atom"
```

### ✅ Check Your Settings

To verify everything is correct, run:

```bash
git config --list
```

-----

## 6\. Getting Help

If you ever get stuck or forget a command, use the built-in manuals:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git --help` | Lists the most common commands. |
| `git help <command>` | Opens the manual for a specific command (e.g., `git help init`). |

```

***

### **Summary of what this covers (for your knowledge):**
1.  **Uniformity:** It enforces that Windows users use "Git for Windows" so everyone on your team (Windows or Linux/Mac) types the same commands.
2.  **Identity:** The `user.email` config is the most common mistake beginners make. I highlighted it as **CRITICAL** because if they get it wrong, their commits will look like they came from "Anonymous" on GitHub.
3.  **Editor:** The transcript used `notepad` or `atom`. I included the command for Notepad as the default since it's universally available on Windows, but noted they can change it.

**Would you like to proceed to the next transcript, or do you want to add instructions on how to set up an SSH key (which is often the next hurdle for teams)?**
